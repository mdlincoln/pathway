Description: Given two points in a numeric matrix, find the shortest pathway of 
    evenly spaced points between them. Includes methods for constraining the 
    nearest neighbor search to move in a specific direction, and an interface 
    for implementing other arbitrary conditional constraints on the search 
    space.
